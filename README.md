Made this program as extra credit for my programming class.  It is written in C++.  

You start off with $1000 and you can gamble till you loose or quit anytime you like.

Rules:

7 or 11 on first roll, WIN double your bet
2, 3, or 12 on first roll, LOSE your bet
7, before you make your point, LOSE your bet
